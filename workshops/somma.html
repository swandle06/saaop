	<h2>RATIONALE</h2>
	<p>Recent regulatory efforts in many countries have focused on a toxicological pathway-based vision for human health assessments relying on in vitro systems and predictive models to generate the toxicological data needed to evaluate chemical hazard. A pathway-based vision is equally applicable to ecological risk assessment. Pathway-based analysis of chemical effects opens numerous opportunities to apply non-traditional approaches for understanding the risks of chemical exposure. Similarities in molecular initiating events and key events that lead to toxicological outcomes provide a defensible framework for extrapolating chemical effects across species, even if the specific adverse outcomes differ between species. This opens the door for much more integrated approaches to chemical hazard evaluation in support of either human health or ecological risk assessment, that are based on consideration of pathway-conservation rather than the taxonomic origin of the text system. The objective is to maximize the predictive utility of available information and those data that can be generated most efficiently and cost effectively. However, these promising concepts and approaches for using pathway-based data in hazard screening and risk assessment need further development in order to realize their full potential.</p>
	
	<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
	<p>This workshop focused on the use of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept as a framework to characterize, organize, and define predictive relationships between measurable key events that reflect the progression from a chemical-induced perturbation to an adverse outcome considered relevant to regulatory decision-making. Previous workshops have considered the utility of AOPs for supporting predictive ecotoxicology and development of less animal-intensive alternatives to existing chronic ecotoxicity tests. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has initiated an AOP development workplan and published a guidance document on developing and assessing AOPs (http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/testing/molecularscreeningandtoxicogenomics.htm). The OECD guidance and AOP Development Program integrate the AOP concept as defined within the ecotoxicology community with the mode of action (MOA) framework developed by a World Health Organization (WHO), International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). Most notably, this introduced consideration of the Bradford-Hill criteria and weight of evidence evaluation in defining the relative level(s) of uncertainty associated with AOP-based extrapolation/predictions, a critical consideration when applying AOPs in a regulatory context. The objective of the present workshop was to build upon these previous efforts and provide consideration and expert opinion on the critical next steps required to advance the use and acceptance of the AOP framework to support integrated toxicology and regulatory decision-making. Specifically, the workshop participants addressed the following five topics:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Research priorities for development of AOPs (WG1).</li>
		<li>Strategic approaches to AOP development (WG2).</li>
		<li>Weight of evidence evaluation to define uncertainties associated with predictive relationships represented in an AOP (WG3).</li>
		<li>“Acceptance” of AOPs for regulatory applications (WG4). </li>
		<li>Applying AOPs to support Informed Approaches to Testing and Assessment (WG5).</li>
